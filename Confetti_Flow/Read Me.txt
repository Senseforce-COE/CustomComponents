How to Use Confetti Files 
This component will be able to be called from a flow. 

1. confetti.broswer.min.js - upload this to static resources and name it Confetti (If you don't name it Confetti, remember to change it in the cmp file)

If you figure out how to make confetti auto launch without the button's in a flow, please let Armaan know.
